# Big-Data-Project
As of 2021, almost all the commodities such as clothes, electronics, everyday use groceries as well as services such as house cleaning, plumbing services etc. are sold online on E-commerce websites. It is safe to say that we humans have understood its vitality in our lives and can consider like our best friend. And like any best friend E-commerce websites too have taken up the task to use existing transaction Big Data (sometimes in size of GB’s ) and run Big Data technologies on them to analyze the data quickly and make well informed decisions to improve user experience, predict sales to make sure the companies are ready for heavy days as well as recommend products to us, making it a more personal and thus enriched experience to use these websites. Recommendation systems have started gaining momentum in companies such as Amazon with its recommendation engine that recommends a personalized list of products as soon as we login or Spotify with its list of songs that we are most likely to listen to it. 

we used PySpark, Spark ML algorithms, and ArcGIS to build predictive model and recommendation system, so as to conduct pricing, marketing and sales strategies. 
According to our predictive analysis, we suggest the company make adequate preparation for large amounts of sales on April 6th, April 8th, May 19th and June 15th in the next year. We suggest the company to conduct maintenance work during 2 am to 4 am considering the traffic. Based on our geospatial analysis, we advise the company to target at Sao Paulo area given the largest revenue, meanwhile, it’s better to develop rural area, which are very potential area. According to customer segmentation analysis, we suggest that the company can target at high spending new customers, create customer profiles for low value customers and dive it deeper to figure out the reason for the large composition of low value customers. In this way, we can better develop marketing strategies and conduct marketing penetration for low value customers. Lastly, we generate recommendation product for each customer.

We have used the Brazilian e-commerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. This dataset can be found on Kaggle here : https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce.
